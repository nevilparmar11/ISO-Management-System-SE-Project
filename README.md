# ISO-Management-System-SE-Project
The proposed system is developed for University to minimize the paperwork and to provide the facility of filling and evaluating their ISO forms digitally. University faculties, through this web application, will be able to log in, fill up forms which are further evaluated by higher authorities and if they find any ambiguity in form details then they can take appropriate actions. The proposed system is the first version of WEB based application that is to be developed for the university to manage their ISO form system. This system specifies the functionality of login by faculty members,coordinators and HOD (Head Of Department).It also provides the feature to enable, fill up and review the form. <br/>
